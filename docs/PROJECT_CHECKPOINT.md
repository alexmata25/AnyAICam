# AnyAiCam — Project Checkpoint (read this first, every session)

**This file is the project's memory, not the AI's.** Before any AI session
begins development work on AnyAiCam, it must:

1. Read this file.
2. Read the authoritative-branch section below and confirm which Git
   branch/commit is the current golden foundation.
3. Read the checkpoint file for whichever appliance/workstream is being
   resumed (`docs/checkpoints/RYZEN.md`, `docs/checkpoints/SAMSUNG.md`).
4. Verify the actual current state (SSH in, check running commit/image, check
   the real database) against what the checkpoint claims — a checkpoint is a
   snapshot, not a guarantee, and drift between sessions is exactly the
   failure mode this file exists to catch.
5. Only then decide the next step. Do not reconstruct project history from
   chat memory, and do not re-fix something this file says is already fixed
   without first checking whether it's actually still broken.

Before switching appliances, branches, or major workstreams — or ending a
session with meaningful progress made — **update the relevant checkpoint file
and commit it**, in the same spirit as this file's own existing update
discipline. A checkpoint that isn't updated is worse than no checkpoint: it
actively misleads the next session.

## Why this file exists

Investigated 2026-09-11: real, completed work had spread across multiple
diverged Git branches with no single source of truth, and several real fixes
existed only as manual runtime patches on Ryzen, staging, or AWS — never
committed to source. This meant the same bugs (empty AWS_REGION building a
malformed S3 endpoint, a missing `restart_count` column, portal URL not
persisting through activation) were independently rediscovered and re-fixed
multiple times across different sessions and branches, because nothing told
the next session they'd already been found and fixed elsewhere.

See `docs/reconciliation-2026-09-11.md` for the full inventory, conflict
resolution, and test evidence behind the reconciliation this file records.

## Authoritative branch

**Current golden foundation:** `reconcile/golden-foundation-20260911`

This branch merges, with deliberate conflict resolution (not a blind merge):
- `claude/customer-provisioning-phase1` — customer entitlements, Stripe
  checkout/webhooks, hardware fulfillment/returns, tenancy
- `staging/cloud-integration-repair` — the Samsung-validated claim flow,
  installer/privileged-watcher fixes, agent config-precedence fix
- `codex/motion-event-media-cloud-flow` — motion-cloud event-media transport
  (Phase C real-hardware validated on Ryzen), Live View fixes (degraded ≠
  offline, malformed JS template literal), AWS_REGION fail-loud guard,
  `restart_count` migration

**As of this writing, this branch has NOT yet been built into a versioned
image/package, and has NOT been deployed anywhere** (not staging, not Ryzen,
not Samsung). It exists only in the isolated worktree
`AnyAiCam-VMS-reconciliation`. Do not treat it as deployed until a specific
build/deploy record says otherwise, added below.

**Once a golden build exists, record it here:**

```
GOLDEN BUILD: <version/build id> — commit <full sha>
Built: <date>
Deployed to: <staging|Ryzen|Samsung, with dates>
```

*(Not yet filled in — no build has been produced yet as of 2026-09-11.)*

## Known, confirmed-live defect classes to never silently re-introduce

These were each found independently more than once across different
sessions/branches before being fixed once, permanently, in the golden branch.
If a symptom matching one of these appears again, check whether the fix is
actually present in the code currently running — do not assume it's a new
bug and re-invent a fix:

1. **Empty `AWS_REGION`/`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`** silently builds
   `https://s3..amazonaws.com` and fails uploads with a cryptic
   `ValueError: Invalid endpoint`. Fixed in both `recording_uploader.py` and
   `live_relay_uploader.py` — both now raise a specific `RuntimeError` before
   ever constructing an S3 client. Regression tests:
   `app/tests/test_aws_region_configuration_guard.py`.
2. **Missing `appliances.restart_count` column** — any database built from
   `db_migrations.py` alone must have it; heartbeat 500s otherwise the moment
   an appliance reports a restart. Regression tests:
   `app/tests/test_appliance_restart_count_migration.py`,
   `app/tests/test_appliance_cloud_restart_count.py`.
3. **Activation not persisting portal URL/cloud identity** — `AgentConfig.
   load()` must not let the installer's own untouched bootstrap placeholder
   silently override a value a successful claim/activation already
   established; `_finish_enrollment()` must write `ANYAICAM_CLOUD_URL` into
   the VMS's own `vms.env` and queue a VMS restart on every (re-)activation.
   Both live in `appliance-agent/anyaicam_agent/config.py` and
   `setup_wizard.py`. **Known incomplete edge case:** an appliance with a
   real, non-default, but *stale* env value (not the installer's bootstrap
   placeholder) can still have that stale value win — this was Ryzen's exact
   failure mode in the 2026-09-11 session and is not yet fully closed. See
   `docs/checkpoints/RYZEN.md`.
4. **`degraded` appliance health treated identically to fully
   offline/unreachable** — a disk-space or CPU warning must not block Live
   View the way a genuinely unreachable appliance should.
   `GET /api/customer/cameras/{id}/status` now returns a distinct `degraded`
   state; the client still starts the session, surfacing a warning instead
   of refusing outright. Regression tests:
   `app/tests/test_customer_camera_status_health_states.py`.
5. **Malformed JavaScript template literals in generated customer pages**
   can silently kill an entire inline `<script>` block with no visible error
   to the customer. General protection (not just the one incident):
   `app/tests/test_generated_customer_pages_js_syntax.py` parses every
   generated `<script>` block with a real JS engine (esprima).
6. **Two competing recording-upload systems** — the old, pre-tenant-model
   `cloud_upload_worker()` in `main.py` and the new, properly IAM-scoped
   `recording_uploader.py` were both being started as separate background
   tasks. `recording_uploader.py` is authoritative. *(Status of removing the
   old worker: see `docs/reconciliation-2026-09-11.md` — verify before
   assuming this is closed.)*

## Appliance checkpoints

- `docs/checkpoints/RYZEN.md` — the real 5-camera physical appliance, primary
  validation hardware.
- `docs/checkpoints/SAMSUNG.md` — waiting at the cloud identity/activation
  stage. **Do not restart Samsung setup from the beginning** — read that file
  first.
